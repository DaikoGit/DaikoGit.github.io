    <p>
        You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="text-red-800 font-bold">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.

        Yeah, a <span class="text-gray-700 font-bold">#444 is cool</span> but a <span class="text-gray-800 font-bold">#454545 is better</span>.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
    <p>
        Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.

                We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a <span class="text-red-800 font-bold">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. Add some relevant pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader. Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're not reading a book on a Kindle.

    <p>Well, and you're right. That site is inspired by the style of <span class="wr">THIS WEBSITE</span> brudah.<br><small>and yes, it even uses css files from this website haha</small></p>
    <h2>Useful links</h2>
    <p>
      Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the
      glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><i><a href="https://google.com/">Holub website <3</a></i></b>
      </li>
      <li>
        The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the
        
      </li>
      <li>
        Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32
        Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)
      </li>
      <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
      <li>
        Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem
        <small>well, kind of</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone
        can enjoy it
        <small
          >but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions
        - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people
        who still use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called
        "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking
        styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is
        proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't include any tracking service
        <small>this website does, but hey, I gotta see who visits me!</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <i>some</i> fucking <span class="colored" id="rbw">colors</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Links don't really need to keep that
        <span class="sb">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that
        <span class="sv">violetish color</span> when they are marked as visited.
        Just give them a
        <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Album</h2>
    <p>
      This website is even better than the last
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's over a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so
        nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different
        for everyone, pshht!).
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses one of the most general
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out
        there: .website
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out
        <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the kickass
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see
        the gorgeous lock?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>: a better alternative
        than Apache Server
        <small
          >honestly, this whole thing runs now behind Traefik as well, but
          you'll never notice it</small
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses
        <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
          >a custom version</a
        >
        of the awesome
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <b>/s</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best
        thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he
        will switch from
        <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap he uses</a> to
        <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/dd60b11e9762b6e25f6d4ce981a1eeae.svg"
          title="JavaScript logo"
          height="0.5em"
        />, CSS3
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/45e80336c935b524911a6d3f3767448d.svg"
          title="CSS3 logo"
          height="0.5em"
        />
        and HTML5
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/cff75e1839f9200f5b983ebbfbaa65ee.svg"
          title="HTML5 Logo"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the
        website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered
      </li>
      <li>
        It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious
        bandwidth if you visit the website more than once
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, a free and Open Source
        analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)
      </li>
      <li>
        It allows universal access from every website via
        <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It is
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's Open Source, freely available on
        <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/"
          >GitHub</a
        >, and everybody can contribute to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the
        <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/"
          >WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a
        >, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
        <p class="fakepre">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
    <p>
      Yeah, a <span class="foufoufou">#444 is cool</span> but a
      <span class="foufivfoufivfoufiv">#454545 is better</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a
      <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
    <p>
      Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a
      fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't
      exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.

        <p>
          We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a
          <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. Add some relevant
          pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader.
          Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have
          nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're
          not reading a book on a Kindle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make
          the user happy while reading your nonsense words.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see the picture of this cute cat? He's happy, and you should be
          too.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
    <p>
      But this doesn't mean you should load your
      <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span> with shitty animations. Keep
      it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the
      IPoAC users, less requests (with a small size) = faster load time! Oh and
      by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put
      everything in a 10MB main.js file, there are people out there who are
      still using 56k modems and haven't tried
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#FTTH"
        >futuristic technologies</a

    <blockquote>
      <span>Good design is as little design as possible.</span
      ><author>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</author>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That's not entirely true, look at that
      <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. It's so minimal that it
      seems like I'm reading the <i>txt</i> version of the
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt">SMTP RFC (RFC5321)</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>
      Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"
        ><span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span></a
      >
      and the
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"
        ><span class="mfw">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</span></a
      >. Despite the criticism here, they're beautiful and truly among the best
      websites on the internet (even though this is still
      <span class="mfw">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span>), so go check 'em
      out. Nevertheless, this shows that the internet has taken a really wrong
      turn - I honestly miss the time when websites were made to convey
      information. At least, thanks god, we got rid of pop-ups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web
      great again"

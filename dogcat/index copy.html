    <p>
      This is my probably / hopefully final design of my personal website.<br>
      <b id="rnbw">Design is my passion haha xD</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Explanation why this is the best mother f*cking website ever:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It doesn't eat all my time</li>
      <li>It isn't annoying making it</li>
      <li>It contains A LOT MORE content then my previous websites <br><small>(and I think websites should convey some information rather than just pretty design that I'll get bored of some day...)</small></li>
      <li>It is pretty :3</li>
      <li>It does easily work on any device <br><small>well, probably not your microwave, but you get it...</small></li>
      <li>It can be shown almost the same in browser like links :3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, and you're right. That site is inspired by the style of <span class="wr">THIS WEBSITE</span> brudah.<br><small>and yes, it even uses css files from this website haha</small></p>
    <h2>Useful links</h2>

      This website is even better than the last
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's over a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so
        nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different
        for everyone, pshht!).
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses one of the most general
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out
        there: .website
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out
        <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the kickass
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see
        the gorgeous lock?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>: a better alternative
        than Apache Server
        <small
          >honestly, this whole thing runs now behind Traefik as well, but
          you'll never notice it</small
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses
        <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
          >a custom version</a
        >
        of the awesome
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <b>/s</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best
        thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he
        will switch from
        <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap he uses</a> to
        <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/dd60b11e9762b6e25f6d4ce981a1eeae.svg"
          title="JavaScript logo"
          height="0.5em"
        />, CSS3
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/45e80336c935b524911a6d3f3767448d.svg"
          title="CSS3 logo"
          height="0.5em"
        />
        and HTML5
        <img
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/cff75e1839f9200f5b983ebbfbaa65ee.svg"
          title="HTML5 Logo"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the
        website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered
      </li>
      <li>
        It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious
        bandwidth if you visit the website more than once
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, a free and Open Source
        analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)
      </li>
      <li>
        It allows universal access from every website via
        <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It is
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's Open Source, freely available on
        <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/"
          >GitHub</a
        >, and everybody can contribute to it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
    <p>
      Yeah, a <span class="foufoufou">#444 is cool</span> but a
      <span class="foufivfoufivfoufiv">#454545 is better</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a

    <h2>My Music</h2>
    <p>
      Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a
      fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't
      exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.

          We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a
          <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. Add some relevant
          pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader.
          Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have
          nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're
          not reading a book on a Kindle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make
          the user happy while reading your nonsense words.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see the picture of this cute cat? He's happy, and you should be
          too.

      That's not entirely true, look at that
      <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. It's so minimal that it
      seems like I'm reading the <i>txt</i> version of the
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt">SMTP RFC (RFC5321)</a>
    </p>
    <h2>If you're interested, there's something about me:</h2>
    <p>
      Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"
        ><span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span></a
      >
      and the
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"
        ><span class="mfw">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</span></a
      >. Despite the criticism here, they're beautiful and truly among the best
      websites on the internet (even though this is still
      <span class="mfw">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span>), so go check 'em
      out. Nevertheless, this shows that the internet has taken a really wrong
      turn - I honestly miss the time when websites were made to convey
      information. At least, thanks god, we got rid of pop-ups.

    <p>
      Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web
      great again"
